What is Linux?
- Linux is an open-source operating system modelled on UNIX. It’s the foundation of many cloud infrastructures and has a significant presence in the server world, among other places.

✨ Basic Fundamentals of Linux:
- Kernel: It’s the core component of the system that interacts with hardware.
- Shell: An interface that allows users to interact with the kernel using command lines or scripts.

File System: Hierarchical structure where all the data is organized.

- Processes: Running instances of programs. Linux treats almost everything as a process.

- User & Groups: Security and permissions are based on users and groups.

✨ The Command Line Interface (CLI)

One of the defining features of Linux is the command line interface or CLI. Unlike graphical user interfaces (GUIs), the CLI requires users to type commands to interact with the system. This might seem intimidating at first, but it offers significant advantages, such as greater control and efficiency.

Common Linux CLI commands:

ls: List files and directories.
cd: Change the current directory.
mkdir: Create a new directory.
touch: Create a new file.
cp: Copy files or directories.
mv: Move or rename files or directories.
rm: Remove files or directories.
pwd: Print the current working directory.

✨ File System Hierarchy

Linux organizes files and directories in a hierarchical structure. The root directory is denoted by /, and all other directories and files branch out from there. Understanding this hierarchy is crucial for navigation and proper file management.

Common directories include:

/bin: Essential system binaries.
/etc: Configuration files.
/home: User home directories.
/usr: User-installed software.
/var: Variable data (e.g., logs).
/tmp: Temporary files.
/dev: Device files.
✨ Users and Permissions

Linux is known for its robust user and permission management system. Each user has a unique username and belongs to one or more groups. File permissions are specified using a combination of read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions for the owner, group, and others.

The chmod command is used to change file permissions, while chown is used to change file ownership. Understanding and managing these permissions is crucial for securing your system.

✨ Package Management

Linux distributions come with package management systems that make it easy to install, update, and remove software. For instance, Ubuntu uses apt, while CentOS uses yum. These tools fetch software from online repositories, ensuring that you always have access to the latest updates and security patches.

To install a package, you typically use a command like:

sudo apt-get install package_name

✨ Update and Upgrade

Regular system updates and upgrades are essential to keep your Linux system secure and up-to-date. Use the following commands to perform these tasks:

sudo apt-get update: Update the package lists.
sudo apt-get upgrade: Upgrade installed packages.
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade: Upgrade the distribution.

✨ System Information

You can retrieve important system information using various commands, such as:

uname -a: Display system information.
df -h: Show disk usage.
free -h: Display memory usage.
top or htop: Monitor system processes.
